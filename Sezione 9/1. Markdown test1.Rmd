## Examples with Markdown

In this lesson we will see how to create a document featuring both text and code with Markdown. We can normally write on the Markdown document, making sure we add the # symbol to define the titles of the paragraphs

Going to the top right on insert we can add a space for the code in R, which must be limited at the beginning and at the end by three single quotes:

```{r}

summary(iris)

```

### We include a graph by adding the echo = FALSE parameter

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(iris)
```

If we do not add it, the code will be printed, in addition to the image:

```{r}
plot(iris$Species)
```

We can also add code in another programming language:

```{python}
tuple1 = (1,2,3,4,5)
list1 = ["jan", "feb", "mar", "apr"]
```

We can insert titles of various sizes by adding a # or more 
#. The more pound keys we add, the smaller the title will be

# Title 1
## Title 2
### Title 3
#### Title 4


#### We can insert italics text in this way:

*italics1*

_italics2_

#### this way for bold:

**bold1**

__bold2__

#### Build bulleted lists:

* list
* second element of the list
    + subelement 1
    + subelement 2
    
1. second list
2. second element of the second list
    + subelement 1
    + subelement 2

    
#### Building a table:

Table title    | First column
-------------- | -----------------------
Line one       | first value column
Line two       | second value column

#### We can insert a link:

my link goes on [this section of text](www.example_link.com)

#### A mathematical formula:

$$ x * 3.14 $$

#### Or an image

#### We can reduce the size of the image

![logo R](https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.png){width=10%}
