# 1) create the s1 string with content 'I love' and a s2 string with content 'coding with R' and paste the two strings with a space between words

# carry out the operation with the basic functions and with stringr

# 2) save the result in the s3 object

# 3) how many words does the object have? How many characters?

# 4) convert the s3 object into single words and overwrite it in an object with the same name

# 5) check the number of characters with the stringr functions

# 6) create the following s4 vector

s4 <- "Yesterday I went to the market to buy some food, I was in Paris, the temperature was 
warm and it was sunny. In a shop window I saw a nice scarf but the shop was closed, so I took
the mail address to get some informations later. It was shop@nice_scarf.com . I also took the phone number, it
was 3293456213"

# 7) convert s4 to lowercase and uppercase without overwriting the object

# 8) check if the word 'scarf' is present

# 9) extract the email address

# 10) extract the phone number

# 11) replace 'Paris' with a city of your choice

# 12) divide s4 into individual terms using the strsplit() function and the most suitable separator
