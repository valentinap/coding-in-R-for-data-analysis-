# 1) First of all, create a numeric vector you will call vn featuring the numbers 2, 5, 9, 14. Remember to use the c() function

# 2) Now create a vector of characters you will call vc featuring the cities of Naples, London, and Paris. Remember to use c () function and put strings in quotation marks

# 3) Now let's create a logical vector vl featuring two FALSE and 3 TRUE

# 4) Re print the number vector vn

# 5) Calculate the average of vn using the mean() function

# 6) Create another numeric vector vn2 featuring the numbers 4, 7, 11, 21

# 7) Add the two numeric vectors created and then create a tot_vn vector that contains both the two vectors but without adding them

# 8) Sort vector vn2  again with sort() function

# 9) Select the second element from vector vc

# 10) What if you wanted to select the first and third element?

# Now we introduce a new function: the seq() function can be used to create sequences of numbers. We create with R an object seq1 composed of the numbers from one to twenty with this code: seq1 <- seq (1, 20)
# 11) From the seq1 object, extract the elements from the fifth to the ninth

# 12) Always starting from our object seq1 replace the second element with the string "new object"

# 13) print to verify if the operation is correct

# 14) Resume the numerical vector vn. Check its nature with the is.vector() function

# 15) Now let's change the nature of the vector vn with the as.character() function. Save the result in the vnc object and print the object to verify that each element is enclosed in quotation marks
