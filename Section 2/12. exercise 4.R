# 1) create an arr1 array featuring 30 elements and divided into 3 rows, 2 columns and 5 elements

# 2) select the fourth element from arr1

# 3) select the rows 1 and 3 from arr1

# 4) create an arr2 array with the numbers 1 to 24 on 4 columns, 3 rows, and two other dimensions, one of 2 and one of 3 elements

# 5) create a vector v1 featuring the numbers 5,7, 11, 19

# 6) create a matrix mat1 composed by numbers from 1 to 9 on three rows

# 7) create a list l1 including the arr1 array, the vector v1 and the matrix mat1, and adding the Orange dataset which is already pre-installed on R

# 8) extract the second element, v1

# 9) extract the first element, arr1

# 10) from the first element extracted from the list extract the rows 1 and 3

# 11) create a factor f1 including the types of blood groups and print it to check the levels

# 12) create a vector owl1 that records the following data: Acceptable, Poor, Acceptable, Disappointing, Troll, Disappointing, Poor, Beyond All Expectations, Acceptable, Exceptional, Exceptional, Troll

owl1 <- c('Acceptable', ‘Poor’, 'Acceptable', ‘Disappointing’, 'Troll', ‘Disappointing’, ‘Poor’, ‘Beyond All Expectations’, 'Acceptable', 'Exceptional', 'Exceptional', 'Troll')

# 13) add Exceptional, Beyond Any Expectations, Acceptable, Poor, Disappointing and Troll levels to the vector and order them from the highest to the lowest level. Save everything in the owl2 factor

# 14) create a table to get an overview of the owl2 factor
