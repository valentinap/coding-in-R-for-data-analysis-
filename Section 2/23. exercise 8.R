# check if v1 is greater than v2

# 2) create a loop with if and else that tells if a number is positive or negative and test it

# 3) create a function that multiplies two numbers and apply it to two numbers of your choice

# 4) create a function that multiplies a number by 5 and apply it to number 22

# 5) create a loop using for that prints the words of the following vector and counts the characters of each word

words <- c('Hi', 'love', 'coding', 'with', 'R')

# 6) create an object x equal to 1 with the help of while create a loop that at each step add 1 to x and stop when the value of x reaches 10
