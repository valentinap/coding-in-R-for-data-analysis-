# 1) Load the numbeo.csv file, with RColorBrewer or basic functions # create a color palette of your choice, and create a barplot and pie chart # with the continent variable# 2) Create two mosaic charts starting from the Titanic dataset (already preloaded in R,) # comparing the gender and class variables with the survival rate# 3) Using the plot() function, create a chart allowing you to have a glance # on all the variables in the numbeo dataset, then create one that shows you # if the Restaurant.Price.Index and Groceries.Index variables tend to covariate# Create a chart that relates the Cost.of.Living.Index variable to the Groceries.Index # variable by editing the pch parameter # 4) After loading the quantmod library, create the tl1 object (these are stock market quotes) # then use the plot() function with the parameter for lines to create a graph that # shows us the trend over time of the value of the shares library(quantmod)tl1 <- getSymbols("AAPL", src = "yahoo", from = "2012-01-01", to = "2023-01-01",                   auto.assign = FALSE)# 5) Create two boxplots, one with the base function of R and one with the qplot() function # to compare the Cost.of.Living.Index and continent variables from the numbeo dataset# 6) Using the same variables add the facets parameter to get the graph divided by continent with ggplot # 7) Use the qplot() function to create a scatterplot of the Cost.of.Living.Index and Groceries.Index variables# 8) Create a barplot with the ggplot() function to plot the continent # variable by coloring each continent a different color# 9) Create a scatterplot of the Petal.Width and Petal.Length variables of the iris dataset # with the ggplot () function, coloring by Species # 10) Save the chart in a g2 object. Finally, add title and axis names
